Description: This package is a compendium of functions that were written
    for multiple projects associated with data analysis requirements of
    the PSC CTC. There were four projects: performance analysis of the 
    chinook calibration model; translation of AWK for importing .hrj files;
    graphing tools related to .hrj data; and rewriting of the Visual Basic
    code that allows for estimation of the stratified proportional fishery
    index (SPFI). Some of the functions overlap between projects based on 
    commonality of data inputs or outputs. Refer to the vignette for detailed
    descriptions of these tools.
